# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-IOT
The Obstacle avoidance robotics is used for detecting obstacles and avoiding the collision. This is an autonomous robot. The design of Obstacle avoidance robot requires the integration of many sensors according to their task. The Obstacle detection is the primary requirement of this autonomous robot.The robot gets the information from surrounding area through mounted sensors on the robot.Some sensing devices like infrared sensors,bump sensors,ultrasonic sensor etc.Ultrasonic sensor is most suitable for obstacle detection and it is of low cost and as hidh ranging capability.The motors are connected through motor driver IC to micro controller.The ultrasonic sensor is attached infront of robot.
